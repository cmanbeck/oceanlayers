				    		<h2>Epipelagic</h2>
                <p>The only zone of the ocean on which the sun shines, the epipelagic zone is the most diverse layer in both its wildlife and climate. It extends about 200m (660ft) from the surface and is the only area in the ocean where plants can perform photosynthesis, making it rich in oxygen. However, as most sediment sinks to the bottom of the sea, the epipelagic zone is relatively low in nutrients. Most of the fish, mammals, plankton, and plants in the ocean are found in this area. Many animals here use a method of camoflauge called countershading, in which they are darker on the top and lighter on the bottom. If viewed from above, the animal will blend in with the darker water or ocean floor, and when looked at from below, it will blend in with the sunlit water.</p>

				    		<h2>Mesopelagic</h2>
              <p>The second layer of the ocean is the mesopelagic zone. In this zone, light is scarce, and many animals have developed bioluminescence as a result. Scientists theorize that the ability to glow in the dark is useful to organisms because it allows them to communicate, camoflauge, or attract prey. The mesopelagic zone reaches from 200m (660ft) to 1000m (3280ft) below the surface. There is no plant life and little food, so many of the animals in this zone migrate to the epipelagic zone at night. In fact, due to these nocturnal mass migrations, at one point sonar waves falsely identified these animals as an ocean floor that rose closer to the surface at night.</p>

				    		<h2>Bathypelagic</h2>
              <p>Also known as the midnight zone, the bathypelagic zone is the first zone in which there is no light at all save for that produced by the organisms living in it. Spanning the range of 1000m (3280ft) to 4000m (13,100ft) beneath the surface, the water pressure is extreme and the temperature can be as low as 4º Celsius (39º Farenheit), yet many organisms manage to thrive in these conditions. Many of the fish in this region lack a swim bladder, an organ that allows them to swim up and down. They instead have a body mass with a higher concentration of lipids, neutralizing their buoyancy under the immense pressure.</p>

				    		<h2>Abyssopelagic</h2>
              <p>Even more daunting than the bathypelagic zone is the abyssopelagic zone. From 4000m (13,100ft) deep to the ocean floor, the water pressure is crushing and the temperature is near-freezing. Exploration is very difficult for humans due to these conditions. This layer is mainly populated by invertebrates such as starfish and squids, but some fish are able to live here. Three-fourths of the ocean floor is found in the abyssopelagic zone. Scientists used to believe that all life was dependant on photosynthesis, but research about this eternally dark abyss has shown the possibility of the earliest life forms being based off of chemosynthesis.</p>

				    		<h2>Hadalpelagic</h2>
              <p>The final layer is the hadalpelagic zone. Named after Hades, the Greek god of death, this zone is made up of all the deep sea trenches below the abyssopelagic zone. Due to even more intense pressure and frigid temperatures, research of this zone is limited. It is hard to classify this zone since many trenches are isolated from each other and therefore have their own ecosystems. However, this also means that the hadalpelagic zone may have more diversity than the zones above it despite the seemingly impossible living conditions. Starfish and tube worms, for instance, are populous in hadal trenches. As of 2014, 400 different species have been found to live in this zone.</p>

				    		<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>The ocean makes up almost 71% of the Earth's surface.</li>
                <li>More than 97% of all the planet's water is found in the ocean</li>
                <li>About 99% of organisms on Earth live in the ocean, yet humans have only explored about 10% of it.</li>
                <li>The Great Barrier Reef is a natural ecosystem made up of corals, making it the largest living structure on Earth. It measures about 2000km (1,243mi) long and is even visible from space.</li>
                <li>At the deepest point in the ocean, water pressure is more than 8 tons per square inch. To put that in perspective, imagine a single person trying to hold up 50 jumbo jets.</li>
                <li>Even though coral reefs comprise less than 0.5% of the ocean floor, scientists estimate that more than 90% of marine organisms are directly or indirectly dependent on them.</li>
                <li>There is as much ice in Antarctica as there is water in the Atlantic Ocean.</li>
                <li>90% of volcanic activity occurs in the ocean, especially in the Ring of Fire, a region formed on tectonic plate borders that contains about 1,133 volcanoes.</li>
